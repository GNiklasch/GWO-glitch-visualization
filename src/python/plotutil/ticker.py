"""A custom minor formatter for use in `matplotlib` figures where the x-axis

scale.

    Formats (minor) tick values as integers, but avoids overcrowding
    (which also requires a judicious choice of font sizes for the major
    and minor labels).
    For use with `matplotlib.ticker.LogFormatter` (base = 10) as the
    major formatter, and adapted to the range of frequencies occurring
    in strain-based PSD or ASD plots (from 8 or 10 Hz to 8192/âˆš2 Hz).

    (This works around a quirk in `LogFormatter`, which would happily
    produce "10^2.48" instead of "300" when a test for `x == int(x)`
    happens to fail.  It gracefully supports another `matplotlib` quirk
    viz. automatically expanding the view to a whole decade when lower
    and upper xlims coincide.)
